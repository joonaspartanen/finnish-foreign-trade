# Finnish Foreign Trade Visualized: Full Stack Web Development Project Work

## General info
This is a project work for the Helsinki University [Full Stack Web Development course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). 

Finnish Foreign Trade Visualized is a web application that uses [the Finnish Customs Uljas API](https://tulli.fi/en/statistics/uljas-api) to fetch statistical data on Finnish foreign trade (imports and exports) and visualizes it using interactive maps and charts. The user can filter the data by year, country of origin, country of destination, commodity code, etc.

## Technologies

The application backend uses Node.js and the frontend will be built with React, though additional technologies may be introduced during the development.

Some JavaScript library or framework will be used for the data visualization purposes.

## Getting Started

The application will be later available on Heroku.
